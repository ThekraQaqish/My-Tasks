# updating README with submission questions

## Submission Questions

What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?
I learned how to structure a basic HTML & CSS project, how to push changes to a specific Git branch, and how to use pull requests effectively. I’m curious to learn more about responsive design and how to organize styles in larger projects.

How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And how long did you expect it to take?  
It took me around 4 hours to complete. I expected it to take about 2 hours, but it took a bit more because I explored extra styling options and fixed some layout issues.
